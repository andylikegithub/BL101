    "## Introduction into GameFi/SocialFi\n",
    "This week we will be diving into the newly developing field of blockchain application: GameFi/SocialFi. Let's start with defining the two fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **GameFi (GameFinance)** involves blockchain games that offer economic incentives to play them, otherwise known as play-to-earn games. Typically, players can earn in-game rewards by completing tasks, battling other players or progressing through various game levels. Additionally, the player is able to own game assets in form of NFTs that can evolve and develop throughout the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **SocialFi (SocialFinance)** is a combination of social networking and finance to create decentralized social applications. Typically, network participants interact through social challenges, through which they can earn in-game rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguably, this field will offer a new cycle of Blockchain innovation beyond DeFi, and possibly initiate mass adoption to attract an entirely new wave of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while GameFi/SocialFi shows promise, recent examples have branded this industry to be more of a ponzi scheme rather than a new and exciting developing field. As such, we will critically address the issues the industry have faced while also outlining the potential for growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that GameFi and SocialFi are categories on their own and should be differentiated. Currently however, a lot of projects are intertwined in either category which makes it difficult to fully seperate them. We expect that the differences will become more clear and distinct as the fields develop. Lets' dive."

    "\n",
    "The global video gaming market offers the opportunity to acquire 3bn active video game players, and address an industry with a market size of $235bn per year (in 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare this with the current market capitalization in GameFi/SocialFi we are closing in on around [$10bn](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/gaming/?page=1) with an active player base of around [800k](https://dappradar.com/topic/games).\n",

    "\n",
    "As we previously mostly explored the Ethereum Blockchain, which dominated the DeFi era, we are now seeing more and more chains that support promising GameFi projects, and provide the infrastructure with a focus on GameFi. Since GameFi projects generally require a higher scale of transactions due to in-game trades and rewards, a low transaction fee (i.e. gas fee) is critical. This is where Ethereum struggles due to its consensus mechanism and other aspects. At current Ethereum still supports the most amount of GameFi projects, however, the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a close second. While Ethereum puts a lot of emphasis on decentralisation and stability, BSC focusses on quicker and cheaper on chain transactions. Such differences are based on the trade-offs chains have to take. Commonly known also as the [Blockchain Trilemma](https://medium.com/certik/the-blockchain-trilemma-decentralized-scalable-and-secure-e9d8c41a87b3), a term coined by Vitalik Buterin.\n",

    "\n",
    "While Ethereum leads in the amount of GameFi projects supported, the Wax Blockchain leads in the amount of active players with a staggering 43%. A high percentage of that is contributed by a popular GameFi game called [Alien Worlds](https://alienworlds.io/), of which [many are bots](https://thedefiant.io/rogue-bots-are-draining-millions-of-dollars-from-wax-blockchains-star-dapp-alien-worlds/) that have been programmed to play-and-earn to make profits. It is also important to note, that the most promising projects have not come out yet. Most are in beta stage and have not yet officially been launched. Some we will dive into later.\n",

    "[Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) is a virtual world full of pets called Axies. Axies can be battled, collected, and used to earn cryptocurrencies. Players need to connect with a special wallet specially designed for Axies designed for running on *Ronin*, an Ethereum sidechain. Players further need to download the game. Axies is therefore a typical example for a \"weak\" on-chain game with most of the game logic and UX off-chain and the Axie NFT assets on-chain.\n",

    "### On-chain Gaming\n",
    "Blockchain games are games that have some of their core mechanics handled by the blockchain. It’s a continuum ranging from **\"weakly\" on-chain games** that for example only require the player to buy an NFT to play the off-chain game, to **\"strongly\" on-chain games** that require the player to interact with the blockchain in every detail of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a game completely on-chain is difficult to be economically profitable. That is why most of the blockchain games that have been released in the past few years are in a hybrid form, having only a few components of their stack on-chain while running the core part of their game logics on off-chain proprietary servers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"Weakly\" on-chain  \n",
    "For weakly on-chain games the game logic is off-chain. Interoperability is very stricted and only possible between game assets. These game assets are often NFTs representing e.g. a character or a weapon:  \n",

    "|cheaters can be banned more quickly|weak composability and interoperability|\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest downside with weakly on-chain gaming is that the game developer or publisher acts as a central authoritiy and could start censoring, changing rules, increase prices or disappeare. Hence, the concept of *play-to-earn* is finally in the hands of the game publisher.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the good side, the user experience is quite similar to traditional games, and connection time is not a problem. Updates (e.g. to fix bugs) can be done centrally and players who play against the terms of services can be banned quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"Strongly\" on-chain  \n",
    "**Strongly on-chain** games store all assets, skills, game and building logic, etc. fully on the blockchain. Every game component is stored in smart contracts and therefore potentially composable, interoperable, and infinitely duplicable. These components can be NTFs representing skill trees or *quest factory contracts* where anyone can deploy and import their game missions.   \n",
    "Like for all games where the source code is open and the game logic revealed, a certain kind of randomness is necessary. As we briefly discussed in week 2 and 3 (👉🏻 *Oracle Problem*) real randomness is not natively possible on the blockchain and for true randomness only doable with the help of *chainlink vrf*.  \n",

    ">GameFi comes with excitement and skepticism: record-breaking fund-raising, play-to-earn business model, more control for players in the upcoming metaverse, etc. on the one side. And still unsolved issues related to on-chain gaming on the other side. \n",
    "\n",
    "*In the following section we list down some issues which are still not solved and offer perspectives on how to solve them.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|Challenge|Overview|Solution|\n",
    "|--|--|--|\n",
    "|**Multi-accounting**|Mitigate Sybil attacks ruining the gaming experience|1. NFT-based access, 2. Proof-of-humanity, 3. Reputation system |\n",
    "|**Key Management**|Balancing UX and security requirements|1. Local & temporary keys, 2. Smart wallets & multisignature|\n",
    "|**Hiding Information**|Obscuring private gameplay information on a public database|1. Commit-reveal schemes, 2. Zero-knowledge proofs|\n",
    "|**Cheat-to-Earn**|Hack Plack-to-Earn games to earn more rewards|1. Mitigate botting, 2. Decentralized anti-cheat, 3. Reputation system|\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-accounting** refers to how to identify the player. *Most games implicitly rely on the following rule: one player = one human. If not, this means that someone else could be playing in the name of the player*. Possible solutions are:   \n",
    "    - An NFT acts as a proof of ownership. The NFT should also be costly enough so that \"hijacking\" another players account is not worth it.\n",
    "    - To proof a player's human identity can come in many ways: a player can proof her identity by performing specific actions (e.g. minimum number of votes) or the game can have a built-in reputation system for every player (e.g. reputation increases with total time played). Finally, some third-party services (e.g. [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/) offer on-chain identity-checking.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Management** refers to the use of private keys to sign transactions. *The more actions players can perform, the more they will have to sign transactions, the more the Metamask wallet will pop up and annoy the player.* Possible solutions are:   \n",
    "    -   key pairs for \"non-sensitive\" game actions stored temporary (e.g. during game session) local or on a client side \n",
    "    - use of **smart wallets** in which players can define in advance which kind of transactions are allowed\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hiding Information** refers to the problem that every player can look up the others players move on the blockchain. *Games like poker would be useless on-chain*. Possible solutions are:\n",
    "    - Commit-reveal schemes use hashing to store \"game-sensitive\" information on-chain. E.g.: for a game like **rock-scissor-paper** each player would hash his choice together with a number or word. After both players transmitted the hash they have to reveal their number to proof the correctness of their choice.\n",
    "    - Zero-knowledge proofs store only the result of a set of actions on-chain rather than the actions itself (e.g. a cook does not need to reveal it's recipe to prove that he can cook a certain meal or a sudoku solution can be proofed by summing up rows and columns).    \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cheat-to-earn** refers to the problem that players could use *game-bots* which plays in their behalf. This is not pure on-chain gaming problem as more a problem in play-to-earn settings. Possible solutions are:\n",
    "    - make the game settings too difficult for bots  \n",
    "    - implement human interaction (e.g. players need to interact ocassionally on *Discord*)   \n",
    "    - reward player with a \"clean\" cheating history or implement a strict rule that any cheating will result in banning.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*These are all problems that hasn't been solved as a whole by any blockchain game so far. However, some games already implemented solutions to these challenges and further progress can be expected. In the mean-time *weakly-chained gaming* will characterize most games. Also the block time and overall blockchain speed is a problem until blockchains have sped up.*   \n"

    "### SocialFi Development\n",
    "The center of SocialFi is NFTs. NFTs make it possible to securely trade and sell digital content. They enable digital proof of ownership and ledgers on the transference of different virtual and real-world experiences that brands can create for their communities. Brands can generate revenues from these experiences after-the-fact, inspiring them to create viral content in the metaverse.\n",

    "**Virtual commerce** (vCommerce) refers to a blend of digital and physical commerce. Unlike eCommerce, vCommerce will build a more seamless blend of digital and physical realities.  \n",

    "It can be also expected that more and more GameFi and SocialFi projects will merge together into the metaverse. For example: the *TIME* magazin (alrady owner of *[TIME Pieces](https://time.com/collection/timepieces-nft/)* - an NFT collection community) just announced a joint venture with *The Sandbox* to work together on the metaverse. \n",
    "\n",
    "### GameFi Development  \n",
    "If we count *CryptoKittens* as the first example of how gaming could be introduced onto blockchains in November 2017 - *almost 2 years after Ethereum was introduced* - then we are as of today already 5 years into the GameFi age. \n",
    "\n",
    "The current GameFi landscape consists mostly of \"weakly\" on-chain games with a focus on *play-to-earn*:  in-game rewards can be transacted as NFTs on crypto exchanges and marketplaces, allowing players to cash them out into other cryptocurrencies and ultimately fiat.  The actual gameplay however, is mostly a second priority making current web3 games being dis-engaging and tedious to play with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although static games like *Axies Infinity* still hold the majority of the GameFi market we are starting to see the rise of higher quality metaverse games such as *Decentraland* and *The Sandbox*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical **triple A** game takes years to be built. For example the famous *Grand Theft Auto* by Rockstar took 3 years to develop and with smart contracts being relatively new, it is expected that a true triple A game is still at least a couple of years away. \n",

    "In the meantime it can be expected that more and more triple A game studios enter the blockchain world, bringing experienced game developer into the GameFi ecosystem and maybe transferring sucessfull traditionall games into the system. The *metaverse hype* might foster this. \n",
    "One example of such a studio is *WorldSpark*. With a team formed from multiple triple A game studios, the company raised $3 million in seed funding and is developing an on-chain action MOBA (Multiplayer online battle arena) game entitled *Edenbrawl*. "
