    "## On-chain Gaming\n",
    "Blockchain games are games that have some of their core mechanics handled by the blockchain. It‚Äôs a continuum ranging from **\"weakly\" on-chain games** that for example only require the player to buy an NFT to play the off-chain game, to **\"strongly\" on-chain games** that require the player to interact with the blockchain in every detail of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a game completely on-chain is difficult to be economically profitable. That is why most of the blockchain games that have been released in the past few years are in a hybrid form, having only a few components of their stack on-chain while running the core part of their game logics on off-chain proprietary servers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Weakly\" on-chain  \n",
    "For weakly on-chain games the game logic is off-chain. Interoperability is very stricted and only possible between game assets. These game assets are often NFTs representing e.g. a character or a weapon:  \n",

    "|cheaters can be banned more quickly|weak composability and interoperability|\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest downside with weakly on-chain gaming is that the game developer or publisher acts as a central authoritiy and could start censoring, changing rules, increase prices or disappeare. Hence, the concept of *play-to-earn* is finally in the hands of the game publisher.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the good side, the user experience is quite similar to traditional games, and connection time is not a problem. Updates (e.g. to fix bugs) can be done centrally and players who play against the terms of services can be banned quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Strongly\" on-chain  \n",
    "**Strongly on-chain** games store all assets, skills, game and building logic, etc. fully on the blockchain. Every game component is stored in smart contracts and therefore potentially composable, interoperable, and infinitely duplicable. These components can be NTFs representing skill trees or *quest factory contracts* where anyone can deploy and import their game missions.   \n",
    "Like for all games where the source code is open and the game logic revealed, a certain kind of randomness is necessary. As we briefly discussed in week 2 and 3 (üëâüèª *Oracle Problem*) real randomness is not natively possible on the blockchain and for true randomness only doable with the help of *chainlink vrf*.  \n",

    "### Challenges in on-chain GameFi and how it might be solved <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
    ">GameFi comes with excitement and skepticism: record-breaking fund-raising, play-to-earn business model, more control for players in the upcoming metaverse, etc. on the one side. And still unsolved issues related to on-chain gaming on the other side. \n",
    "\n",
    "*In the following section we list down some issues which are still not solved and offer perspectives on how to solve them.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|Challenge|Overview|Solution|\n",
    "|--|--|--|\n",
    "|**Multi-accounting**|Mitigate Sybil attacks ruining the gaming experience|1. NFT-based access, 2. Proof-of-humanity, 3. Reputation system |\n",
    "|**Key Management**|Balancing UX and security requirements|1. Local & temporary keys, 2. Smart wallets & multisignature|\n",
    "|**Hiding Information**|Obscuring private gameplay information on a public database|1. Commit-reveal schemes, 2. Zero-knowledge proofs|\n",
    "|**Cheat-to-Earn**|Hack Plack-to-Earn games to earn more rewards|1. Mitigate botting, 2. Decentralized anti-cheat, 3. Reputation system|\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-accounting** refers to how to identify the player. *Most games implicitly rely on the following rule: one player = one human. If not, this means that someone else could be playing in the name of the player*. Possible solutions are:   \n",
    "    - An NFT acts as a proof of ownership. The NFT should also be costly enough so that \"hijacking\" another players account is not worth it.\n",
    "    - To proof a player's human identity can come in many ways: a player can proof her identity by performing specific actions (e.g. minimum number of votes) or the game can have a built-in reputation system for every player (e.g. reputation increases with total time played). Finally, some third-party services (e.g. [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/) offer on-chain identity-checking.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Management** refers to the use of private keys to sign transactions. *The more actions players can perform, the more they will have to sign transactions, the more the Metamask wallet will pop up and annoy the player.* Possible solutions are:   \n",
    "    -   key pairs for \"non-sensitive\" game actions stored temporary (e.g. during game session) local or on a client side \n",
    "    - use of **smart wallets** in which players can define in advance which kind of transactions are allowed\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hiding Information** refers to the problem that every player can look up the others players move on the blockchain. *Games like poker would be useless on-chain*. Possible solutions are:\n",
    "    - Commit-reveal schemes use hashing to store \"game-sensitive\" information on-chain. E.g.: for a game like **rock-scissor-paper** each player would hash his choice together with a number or word. After both players transmitted the hash they have to reveal their number to proof the correctness of their choice.\n",
    "    - Zero-knowledge proofs store only the result of a set of actions on-chain rather than the actions itself (e.g. a cook does not need to reveal it's recipe to prove that he can cook a certain meal or a sudoku solution can be proofed by summing up rows and columns).    \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cheat-to-earn** refers to the problem that players could use *game-bots* which plays in their behalf. This is not pure on-chain gaming problem as more a problem in play-to-earn settings. Possible solutions are:\n",
    "    - make the game settings too difficult for bots  \n",
    "    - implement human interaction (e.g. players need to interact ocassionally on *Discord*)   \n",
    "    - reward player with a \"clean\" cheating history or implement a strict rule that any cheating will result in banning.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*These are all problems that hasn't been solved as a whole by any blockchain game so far. However, some games already implemented solutions to these challenges and further progress can be expected. In the mean-time *weakly-chained gaming* will characterize most games. Also the block time and overall blockchain speed is a problem until blockchains have sped up.*   \n",
