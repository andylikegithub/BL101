    "#### What are tokens?  \n",
    "Tokens are smart contracts that can represent virtually anything:\n",
    "\n",
    "- reputation points in an online platform  \n",
    "- skills of a character in a game  \n",
    "- lottery tickets  \n",
    "- financial assets like a share in a company  \n",
    "- a fiat currency like USD  \n",
    "- an ounce of gold  \n",
    "- and more...   \n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing you need to know about tokens is that they are not held by accounts. Tokens exist in contracts, which function like decentralized databases that map tokens to the appropriate Ethereum address. Also, it is the token contract that governs and specifies the rules that apply to a given token. With this, developers set the name, symbol, divisibility and other important token identifiers. \n",
    "Hence, the transfer of ownership of tokens only occurs when the current owner sends a request to the contract directing it to allocate part of the balance to another Ethereum wallet address. To register this transfer on the blockchain, the owner must pay a gas fee in ETH.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DeFi-related Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week we learnt about token standards. As a quick review: standards are like templates of solidity contracts with predefined methods. In a DeFi context we can define Token standards as a *set of rules that allow the development of cryptocurrency tokens on different blockchain protocols.*   \n",
    "\n",
    "A widely used standard for building unique tokens is **ERC-721**. We used it when we built our NFT. The following table shows the 4 most important tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "|  Name | Created | Use Cases |\n",
    "| -- |-- |-- |\n",
    "| ERC-20 | 2015 | Fungible token standard that provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved. |\n",
    "| ERC-721 | 2018 | Non-Fungible Token standard |\n",
    "| ERC-777 | 2017 | Standard that defines all the functions required to send tokens on behalf of another address, contract or regular account. |\n",
    "| ERC-1155 | 2018 | A standard for contracts that manage multiple token types. |\n",
    "\n",
    "In the financial world on the other side we need exchangable contracts. Financial instruments are (in most cases) standardized. Think about company stocks, securities, cryptocurrencies or even money. Unlike NFTs which are unique, financial tokens are fungible or interchangeable or even tradeable. In other words: every ERC-20 token usually consists of many tokens. The owner of an ERC-20 (e.g. bitcoin, ether) token is not interested in a specific token rather than the how many of these tokens she gets. The **Mona Lisa** would be ERC721, a **dollar bill** ERC-20. \n",
    "*So what exactly is this ERC-20 standard?*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ERC-20\n",
    "**ERC-20** was introduced in 2015 and provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example functionalities of ERC-20:**\n",
    "- transfer tokens from one account to another  \n",
    "- get the current token balance of an account\n",
    "- get the total supply of the token available on the network\n",
    "- approve whether an amount of token from an account can be spent by a third-party account  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why make an ERC-20?  \n",
    "- Governance token  \n",
    "- Secure an underlying network  \n",
    "- crate a synthetic asset  \n",
    "- et.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a Smart Contract implements the following methods and events it can be called an ERC-20 Token Contract and, once deployed, it will be responsible to keep track of the created tokens on Ethereum.\n",

    "You don't have to write your ERC-20 token from scratch. Different implementations have been written by various teams that have different trade-offs: from gas saving to improved security. You can found examples at [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/9b3710465583284b8c4c5d2245749246bb2e0094/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol).\n",

    "##### ETH vs ERC20  \n",
    "ETH is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain and it acts as the fuel of the network as each operation on the Ethereum blockchain needs to pay a corresponding amount of ‘gas’. Gas prices are denoted in small fractions of ether called gwei (1 gwei = 0.000000001 ETH). While ERC20 is the standard to obey in order to create applications (smart contract), the ERC20 token is serving as a currency for accessing the application.\n",

However, the PBOC has been working on introducing an official digital currency (digital Yuan) since 2012. In late 2020, the Chinese government drafted a law that conferred legal status on PBOC’s digital Yuan: the legislation is expected to result in the demise of the fiat currency, and the introduction of currency controls covering exchanges and currency fungibility. \n",

The Salvadorean government also launched an app, \"Chivo Wallet\", which allowed users to digitally trade both bitcoin and dollars, and gave major incentives to download it. In April 2022 **Central African Republic (CAR)** followed El Salvador to approve Bitcoin as legal tender.\n",
    "Proponents argue that in a country where few people have bank accounts, the adoption of Bitcoin will help encourage savings and offer a safe place to store and transfer money.   \n",
