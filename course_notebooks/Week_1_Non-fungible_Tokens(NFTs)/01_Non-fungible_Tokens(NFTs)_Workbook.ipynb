    "In this mini course we will build something similiar, but way simpler. We will continue with our on-chain svg NFT from `2️⃣ MySecondNFT` and enchance it to a collectible NFT.  \n",
    "I.e. we will dynamically generate SVG NFTs on-chain.  \n",

    "You might discovered `run.js` inside the contracts folder? This time we mint our NFTs locally to check the results.\n",

    "#### 🚀 Deploy to Rinkeby\n",
    "As in our previous courses we want to deploy our collectible to the *real* (testnet) blockchain, mint it and watch it on OpenSea. \n",
    "Run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby` shell, copy the deployment address:  \n",
    "![shell output after executing deploy.js](images/shell-deploy2.png)  \n",
    "\n",
    "and 🔥 fire-up [opensea.io](https://testnets.opensea.io/) and search the newly deployed contract address. Again, don't click enter. *OpenSea is weird so you'll need click the collection itself when it comes up.*\n",
    "In our example:\n",

    "For example, here's my link: `https://rinkeby.rarible.com/token/0xEd029b01E4c72B7B0868b2b43841a7Cc316a0e49:0`  \n",
