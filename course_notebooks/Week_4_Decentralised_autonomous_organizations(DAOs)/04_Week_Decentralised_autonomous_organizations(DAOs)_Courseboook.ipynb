    "## ðŸ“• Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are DAOs and what makes them the perfect governing entity in a web3 world.\n",
    "* Go through examples of voting mechanisms and tokenomics and compare their weaknesses and benefits.\n",
    "* Create your own DAO with which people can interact with and contribute tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“… Weekly Progress\n",
    "\n",
    "|Week | Content | Learning Objectives|\n",
    "|:--- |:--- | :--- |\n",
    "| 0 | Hello Blockchain World | Get to know more about your classmates, the mentors, and learn about the fundamental concepts of the Blockchain, how it works, and write your first smart contract.|\n",
    "| 1 | Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs)| Learn more about Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) and go through the protocols that make them unique and valuable. Create your own NFT collection, deploy it to a Testnet and view it on OpenSea. |\n",
