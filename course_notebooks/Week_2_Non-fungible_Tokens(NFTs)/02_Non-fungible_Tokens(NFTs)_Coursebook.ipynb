    "## What are NFTs?\n",
    "NFT stands for *Non-fungible Tokens*. NFTs are smart contracts deployed on a blockchain that represent something *unique*. Unlike our `helloworld` contract which is fungible (i.e. replaceable, interchangable), NFTs are unique.  Technically NFTs follow a different standard, the so called `ERC721` standard. Fungible tokens in contrast follow the `ERC20` standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "*For example: the dollar bill in your wallet is **fungible**: it might has a serial number and a print date but every bill is interchangeable. You can use it for buying goods, pocket money for your kid or put into a safe (for future use). But whatever you do you are only interested in the value - not in this particular bill. In other words: nobody keeps record about who used this bill for what. \n",
    "The picture you took on your smart phone is **non-fungible**: although you can send it to other people, post it on social media, sell it, ... you will always remain the creator of that image and the blockchain stores your address (and any future owner).*\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are NFTs made of?\n",
    "1. Each NFT has a unique id that distinguishes it form other NFTs. This is in contrast to a fungible token like `ETH`. All ETH are the same and you only care about *how many* ETHs you have.   \n",
    "2. NFTs can link to data stored outside of a smart-contract (called **off-chain**). This makes NFTs more cost-effective as *on-chain* stored data needs to be processed, verified and replicated across the entire blockchain network. "

    "- `Web1` was the beginning of the internet: we had blogs, homepages, company websites, wikipedia, e-commerce, etc. -  using the internet meant for most people *consuming content*. **The internet was mostly static.**  \n",
    "- `Web2` added social media, involving the user into the creating-of-content process - internet then meant *prosuming* (consuming and producing at the same time). However, most user of social platformd did not benefit from their content (beside the fun of sharing and interacting most users did not got compensated for posting on Instagram or tweeting on Twitter) and platforms like Facebook and Google became the most-valuable companies in the world. **The internet became interactive.**   \n",
    "- `Web3` which technically started with the first introduction of blockchain in 2008 but in fact is about to shift the nature of the internet and is for many experts the future of the internet. Besides decentralicing content and therefore putting content into the hand of the *crowd* rather than in the hand of big companies and/or governments (at this point is funny if you think about what the original purpose of the interent was: a decentraliced network owned by the people), it also gives the user the possility to own and monetize his/her content. Although smart contracts based on ERC20 standard also belong to Web3 the idea of non-fungibality and NFTs is so central to this new internet world that we mention it here. **The internet becomes \"ownable\".**\n",

    "Although you could technically store your *digital art* directly on the blockchain (i.e. `onchain`) it would cost too much `gas` (üëâüèª *`gas` is the transaction fee for uploading/changing contracts on the blockchain*). Instead the NFT contains an `URI`. A URI (\"Universal Resource Identifier\") is a string containing characters that identify a physical or logical resource. URI follows syntax rules to ensure uniformity. Moreover, it also mantains extensibilitiy via a chierarchical naming scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every NFT has a unique owner: ```mapping (uint256 => address) private _owners;``` and in addition they have what is called a `TokenURI`. Each token is unique and each tokenID represents a unique asset. If we want to visualize these assets we need to define some attributes, e.g. how does the art looks like, what are the stats of a gaming character, etc.\n",
    "This is were `Metadata` and `TokenURI` come into play. The metadata describes the character of the NFT. The simplest metadata might look like this:   \n",
    "``` \n",
    "\"name\": \"Name\",\n",
    "\"description\": \"Description\",\n",
    "\"image\": \"URI\",\n",
