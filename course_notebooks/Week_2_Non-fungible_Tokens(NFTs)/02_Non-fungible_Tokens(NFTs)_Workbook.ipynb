In this chapter we provide a table with code explanations. You should read the code in `contracts/MyFirstCollectible.sol`. You will find emoji markers (like 1️⃣)there matching the ones in the table below👇🏻). You can also *run* the contract and watch the console output (we put some print statements into the contract which shows you the state of some variables - feel free to add more print statements). We configured the *run*-button in a way that the contract will be deployed locally (in our replit) - i.e. you don't have to wait till the NFT is minted to the blockchain and we are not using gas from our/your Rinkeby test account. Fell free to unocmment print statements or add more.\n",

    "|--|--|--|\n",
    "|🖨|`console.log()`|Useful command provided by the `hardhat` library (we imported it in 3️⃣ c)). It will print the text to the console. To print variables inside text use placeholder like `%s` followed by the variable name after the string. Feel free to uncomment the print statements we provided or add new ones.|\n",
    "|0️⃣|License Identifier|not necessary, but the compiler will print a warning when missing|\n",
    "|1️⃣|`pragma` keyword|what version of the compiler are valid to compile this contract *(solidity is a dynamically developed language: new functionalities are added over time*)|\n",
    "|2️⃣|comments|`//`👈🏻 single-line; `/*`👈🏻 multiline 👉🏻`*/`|\n",
    "|3️⃣ a)|Import statement for `Strings.sol`|imports a library to work with strings. You can see it at: `/artificats/@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Strings.sol`). *Libraries are an efficient way to reduce gas fees, because they are deployed only once at a specific address with its code being reused by various contracts.*|\n",
    "|3️⃣ b)|Import statement for **ERC721**|imports the ERC721 (\"NFT\") solidity contract with all functions as described in the coursebook. You can see it at: `/artificats/@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol`)|\n",

    "|3️⃣ d)|Import statement for printing out statements or variables to the console |it's part of `hardhat` library, not necessary for deploying our contract to the blockchain but useful for developing and debugging|\n",
    "|3️⃣ e)|Import of an helper function |`Base64.sol` contains a function to convert strings to base64 format (like the [online base64 encoder](https://www.utilities-online.info/base64) in the last assignment. You can see it at: `/contracts/libraries/Base64.sol`|\n",

    "|5️⃣ a)|`using Counters for Counters.Counter`|`Counters` is a library we imported in 3️⃣ c). `Counter` is an object to store multiple values (also called `struct` datatype). The expression `using .. for ..`  assigns all the functions inside the `Counters` library to the `Counter` struct|\n",

As we pick these words randomly, our NFT collectibles become unique.|\n",

    "|9️⃣ a)|`pickRandom___word()` (function)|Function that inputs the `tokenId` (a variable defined in and inherited from `ERC721URIStorage`) and returns a variable of type `string`. The function is `public`, i.e. it can be called from everywhere (e.g. from other contracts) and declared as `view`, i.e. the function does not modify the state of the blockchain (🤓 *no gas needed when calling this function*). |\n",
    "|9️⃣ b)|`random()`|this simulates randomness by combining two strings (\"FirstWord\" and a stringified version of `TokenId`) and calling the function `random()` (👉🏻 1️⃣0️⃣). It produces a long integer.|\n",
    "|9️⃣ c)|`rand % firstWords.length`|Modulus of number of words in `firstWords` of the long integer from 9️⃣ b). This produces a number between 0 and 5.|\n",
    "|9️⃣ d)|`firstWords[rand]`|the word from the `firstWords` array at position 9️⃣ c) |\n",
    "|1️⃣0️⃣|`random()`|Simple function which inputs a string and converts it into a `keccak256`-hash. The function is `internal`, i.e. it can only be called from inside this contract. |\n",
    "|1️⃣1️⃣ a)|`mintNFT()`|We call this function in `scripts/deploy.js` to mint a new NFT (we can do this because its of type `public`). This very long function has no input and output values, but it combines our random words and builds the rest of the **svg** we started in 6️⃣ . We can call this function many times and *mint* so new collectibles of our base NFT.|\n",
    "|1️⃣1️⃣ b)|`newItemId = _tokenIds.current()`|build variable `newItemId` set it *number of minted tokens +1* (see also 1️⃣1️⃣ i))|\n",
    "|1️⃣1️⃣ c)|`string memory <var>`|building temporary variables of type `string` to build a sentence or word combination for our **svg** (`memory` says that the variable is stored temporary, like RAM and **not** on the blockchain).|\n",
    "|1️⃣1️⃣ d)|`string memory finalSvg`|storing temporarily the text of our **svg**|\n",
    "|1️⃣1️⃣ e)|`string memory json`|storing temporarily the text of our **json**|\n",
    "|1️⃣1️⃣ f)|`string memory finalTokenUri`|Adding \"data:application/json;base64,\" at the beginning of `json` (1️⃣1️⃣ e)) to build the NFT URI (you can copy the result of `finanTokenUri` and paste it in an [Online NFT Previewer](https://nftpreview.0xdev.codes/) to see your final **svg**). |\n",
    "|1️⃣1️⃣ g)|`_safeMint()`|This function call ([`_safeMint`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721-_safeMint-address-uint256-) is a function from the ERC721 contract we imported in 3️⃣ b)) mints a new collectible with a specific `tokenId` and transfers it to the NFT token address.|\n",
