Ethereum’s long-awaited “merge” (sometimes known as `ETH2`), which Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin says should happen in August.  It will move Ethereum from the energy-intensive “proof of work” system it currently uses to a “proof of stake” system that promises to make the network 99% more efficient while also increasing security and processing speeds.

# Proof-of-work vs Proof-of-stake

||PROOF-OF-WORK|PROOF-OF-STAKE|
|---|---|---|
|NETWORK|Bitcoin|Ethereum (since 08/2022)|
|CHARACTERISTICS|`miners` (i.e. many computers across a decentralized network) agree on which transactions are legitimate|`validators`|
## Future Development
Ethereum is expecting to "merge" its blockchain network to Proof-of-stake (sometimes known as `ETH2`) in August this year. Ethereum promisis to make the network 99% more efficient while also increasing security and processing speeds.

## "Bitcoin Pizza Day"   
Florida programmer Laszlo Hanyecz spent 10,000 BTC on two large Papa John’s pizzas on May 22, 2010 — the first known IRL crypto transaction. People celebrate that day as a reminder of BTC’s mind-bending growth over the last 12 years. *(At BTC’s current price around $30,000, Hanyecz could have bought 20 million large pizzas)*
