# What is Bitcoin?

In the cryptoworld are three very important different layers:

Bitcoin is not just a coin or currency. It's a **prototocol**. Protocols are set of rules that guides how participants communicate over networks. For example:
- `IP`: standards for communicating on the internet
- `https`: standards for browsers to display web sites. 
- `bitcoin`: standards for participants to interact in the bitcoin world (e.g.: how public keys and signatures should be used for authentication, how participants agree on updates to the bitcoin protocol, etc.)

Every protocol has a **coin** attached to it. The coin is mostly named after the protocol.
**Tokens** rely on smart contracts. Ethereum has 100s of tokens. Bitcoin has no token as its technology does not allow to build smart contracts. *(In chapter x we will build our own token)*
