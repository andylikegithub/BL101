## Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
Unlike traditional centralized exchanges (CEXs), DEXs ensure direct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions, relying on self-executing smart contracts to facilitate trading. This allows for instantaneous trades, often at a lower cost than on CEXs.

- `Order book DEX` like Nash Exchange and Tomo DEX
- `Swap DEX` like Uniswap and Balancer
- `DEX aggregator` like 1inch and DeversiFi

## Derivatives trading
Such DeFi platforms allow users to trade tokenized derivatives using smart contracts, without the need for a third party. Any product like options, futures, and collateralized loans can be a derivative.

Popular protocols for derivative trading are [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) and [BarnBridge](https://barnbridge.com/).

These platforms allow lenders to instantly lend cryptocurrencies to borrowers. The main condition is that borrowers have to provide enough collateral to deposit in a smart contract.
