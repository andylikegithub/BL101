## Install MetaMask
> *MetaMask is a wallet for `Ethereum` (and other tokens) that works as a browser extension. It connects to sites and application within your browser (i.e. after visiting the website you click on the `MetaMask` icon to connect your wallet with that website).*

1. Visit [Metmask](https://metamask.io/) and locate the extension that is compatible with your browser *(supported browsers are: `Chrome`, `Firefox`, `Edge` and `Brave`)*.Â 
2. Install the extension ->  *the Metamask Icon  <img src="images/metamask_icon.png"> appears in our browser*
3. Click on the icon <img src="images/metamask_icon.png"> in your browser and follow the setup process.
4. Store/write down the `secret recovery phrase`: *it's the master key to your wallet!*. This will be highly confidential information. Do not share this information with anyone.

## Become familiar with MetaMask
We recommend to **pin** MetaMask to your browser:

)

### Your Public Key
In order to find your public key, you will have to simply click on the MetaMask browser extension and copy the public key in your wallet. Follow the image below for further clarification.

### Your private key
In order to attain your private key, you will have to enter your account details and export the private key. In doing so, you will also need to provide your MetaMask password.

ATTENTION: It is important to note that you should not share your private key to anyone in case you own anything of real value inside that wallet.

### One word about accounts
You can add more accounts to your wallet. *(This can be useful e.g. to learn how to transfer money between accounts.)* Every account will then be available in all your testnets and your mainnet. Every account has an account number (also called `account address`) and a `private key`. You will use both quite often. Whenever you "change" something on the blockchain (transfer money, mint NFT, etc.) you need your account address and your private key - think of them as your *name* and your *signature*.  
The `secret key` belongs to your wallet and therefore to all your accounts. You never use it on the blockchain. *(typical usecases for your secret key is: setting up your wallet on a new computer or smart phone or browser)* 

### Add Testnet
>MetaMask will be your most important tool in the blockchain world. The nice thing about MetaMask: it allows you to use `testnets`. Testnets are ... which allow you to discover, play around and test your application. You can also deposit money (i.e. tokens) on your testnet. But if you want to buy a real NFT you need to use your mainnet with real `ETH` *Let's add some money to your wallet ...*. This will also be explained further in the Week 1 Coursebook.

In order to access and connect to a Testnet it needs to be added to your metamask. You can do that by clicking this link: https://umbria.network/connect/ethereum-testnet-rinkeby and press **switch network** after your metamask was prompted to open.

### Get `Ether` for your wallet
The process for adding `ether` to your wallet depends on the testnet. 

#### Rinkeby Testnet
1. [Rinkeby Faucet](https://rinkebyfaucet.com/)
    - very quick: just paste you wallet address
    - only 0.1 Eth and you have to wait 24h to claim Eth againg
2. [Rinkeby Authenticated Faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)
    - you need `twitter` or `facebook` account
    - for Twitter: 
        1. click on the twitter link
        2. a sample tweet in your twitter account opens
        3. paste your wallet address in that tweet and tweet
        4. copy your tweets link ("share tweet") and paste it into the faucet
    - you can add up to 18.75 Eth (every 3 days)

#### Kovan Testnet   
Unfortunately, Eth for `Kovan` is a little bit more difficult to get than for `Rinkeby`. You can get `Kovan` Eths from a couple of sites:
1. [Kovan Faucet](https://faucet.kovan.network/)
    - site was offline recently ðŸ˜•
2. [Gitter](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet#)
    - you need to sign on with your `twitter`, `github` or `gitlab` account
    - then click on `join room` at the buttom of the page and paste in your wallet address
    - only 0.001 Eth and you have to wait 24h to claim ETH again
3. [Ethdrop](https://ethdrop.dev/)
    - very simply: just paste your wallet address
    - only 0.001 Eth and you have to wait 24h to claim ETH again
#### Mainnet
(we recommend not to deposit real `eth`, i.e. on the mainnet - at least not for now until you become more confident within the blockchain world.). But of course if you want to interact with the "real" blockchain (in a way that you *change* the blockchain, e.g.: buying "real" NFTs, minting "real" tokens, exchanging "real" crypos, etc.) you need to have real `eth`. The quickest way to buy eth is within MetaMask: you can buy via `Paypal`, `Apple Pay`, `Credit Card`, `Bank Transfer`, etc.
Keep in mind that you also need eth for transactions which usually does not cost money (e.g. ...). I.e. because for most transactions you need to pay a transaction fee, so called `gas fee`. It is the compensation for the `miner` who "helps" you with your transaction. 
*But more on this later...*

# Other Wallets
Another famous wallet which functions similar to MetaMask is `Coinbase`:   
![Coinbase Logo](images/coinbase_logo.png)  
Coinbase can store other cryptos while MetaMask focuses on ETH and ERC-20 tokens. Coinbase also functions as a browser add-on. You can download and install it [here](https://www.coinbase.com). But we don't need it for our course.
